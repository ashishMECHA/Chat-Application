# ⭐ Chat-Application ⭐
This project is made by using Java Networking & Socket Programming concepts. JAVA programming language is used to buid this application.


## My Process
<li>I have made two programs, one is playing a role of server and other of client.</li>
<li>ServerSocket and Socket class is used to create server and client.</li>
<li>Then a connection is established between them.</li>
<li>BufferedReader and Printwriter class both are used to read and write text from i/o streams. </li>


## What I learn
👉 Learn about practical use of Socket Programming.   
👉 Establishing connection between sockets.            
👉 Learn about the use of multi-threading in a project.      
👉 Learn about creating a GUI by using Java Swing.


## How to run the Project
First of all, we need an IDE(Integrated Development Environment) that supports Java.

<li>I prefer IntelliJ IDE for running this project.</li>
<li>Then, open the repository containing the project and at first run the server.java file and after that run client.java.</li>
<li>This will open two windows</li>

<li>Server and Client can send and recieve text messages</li>
<li>You can run one of the program on different computer but IP address should be known and both programs should be running on same port.</li>
